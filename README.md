# Game is Hard level 2 walkthrough

You’re staring at **Level 2** and the game is acting like the keyboard died. It didn’t. The text is the keyboard.

## The one-line solve (Level 2)
Drag **y** (from **you**), **e** (from **level**), and **s** (from **this**) onto the three blanks to spell **YES**.

## This repo does two things
- Links the best quick walkthrough for Level 2
- Includes a tiny, playable recreation of the level (so you can test the mechanic)

## Walkthrough link (Level 2)
- **Game is Hard Level 2 guide:** https://gameishard.org/level/2

## Run the recreation
1. Download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in any browser (mobile works too)
3. Drag letters from the sentence into the three underlines

## What the recreation matches
- **No keyboard**
- **Letters are draggable**
- Only the correct letters snap into the blanks
- Win triggers instantly when the blanks read **Y-E-S**

## Pro-tip (the messy one)
On small screens, don’t try to “drop on the line.” Drop a tiny bit *below* the underline so your finger isn’t blocking the slot. The snap will still grab it.

## Repo layout
- `index.html` — the full demo (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
